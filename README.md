Close It is a tiny Windows utility written in [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/). It helps you close window faster by moving your pointer to "Close Window/Close all windows" automatically when you right click on a taskbar button.

## Download ##
You can download the compiled standalone executable `Close It.exe` [here](https://github.com/chaohershi/Close-It/releases/latest). No installation required.

Alternatively, you can download the source code and run the script `Close It.ahk` having AutoHotkey installed.

**Please be aware that if you choose to download and run the executable, you will get warnings from your web browser and Windows SmartScreen.** This is totally normal as the the file is not signed (purchasing trusted code signing certificate would cost a lot of $$$). Nevertheless, the file contains no virus and is 100% safe. Feel free to do a virus scan if you are still worried! Of which I recommend [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).
