## Download ##
You can download the compiled standalone executable `Close It.exe` [here](https://github.com/chaohershi/Close-It/releases). No installation required.

Alternatively, you can download the source code and run the script `Close It.ahk` having AutoHotkey installed.

**Please be aware that if you choose to download and run the executable, you may get popup window from Windows SmartScreen.** This is totally normal. It takes some time for Windows SmartScreen to recognize a new certificate like the one that Close It is using. Nevertheless, Close It is free and minimal and contains no malware of any kind. Feel free to do a virus scan if you are still worried! Or proceed by clicking on the "More info" link and then on the "Run anyway" button.
